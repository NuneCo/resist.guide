# resist.guide

This is a call for a general strike.

This organization effort resides in the Cascadia Bioregion.  
_Please ask your local labour union about participating._

The Covid-19 outbreak presents an opportunity for us to help one another.

We agree that humans deserve basic rights,  
and humanitarian aid is desparately needed by the people,  
regardless of which politician is squabbling with whom these days.

A #GeneralStrike means we agree to refuse non-critical requests for labour.

A #GeneralStrike means we respectfully decline to pay rent,  
after first coordinating with our neighbors.

If we act alone, we will be overwhelmed.

We must unite.

April First,
Stand with your neighbor rather than the employer or the state.

Call for the end of for-profit medical institutuions.  
Call for the end of for-profit lawmaking.  
Call for the end of for-profit war.

If we cannot rebuild our own hospitals,  
why are we overseas dropping bombs?
