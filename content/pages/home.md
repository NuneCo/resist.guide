# resist.guide
This is a call for a general strike.

#GeneralStrike means we agree to refuse non-critical requests for labour.

If we cannot prioritize our own lives over the profits of the faceless profiteers,  
can we be trusted with the future of tomorrow's children?

Are the people of this place and time domesticated to the point of betraying their own families?

Refuse to pay your rent.
Refuse to use your financial privilege to feed the systems killing us.
Refuse to be the one enabling the abuse of your neighbor.

Commerce is the lifeblood of the system.
Without profit, the husk grinds to a halt within days.

They are few.

We are many.

Strike.

Choose to keep power, water, and other infrastructure utilities online.

There is enough for us *all* if we share our ability and excess.

No  healthy human needs *that* many rolls of toilet paper.

Please, if you're that ill,
seek professional help.
